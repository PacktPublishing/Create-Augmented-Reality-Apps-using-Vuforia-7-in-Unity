Virtual Button in Unity 2017.2
Section 2, Lecture 14

For those who want to implement virtual buttons in Unity 2017.2 or later -

Finding a virtual button prefab that may help others wishing to use Unity 2017:

1. Go to the "Sample Scenes" folder (just under the Assets folder).

2. Open the scene called "3-VirtualButtons.unity"

3. Create a prefab with one of the virtual buttons used in the scene.

4. Use this prefab in your scenes.

I hope this helps.
