Notes on Creating a Cylinder Target on Vuforia Developer Portal:

Vuforia has not made it easy to get the correct dimension for creating a cylindrical image target. I suggest you use photoshop or gimp to crop your existing image target to the aspect ratio that they require. 

Alternatively you can use the pre-made cylindrical target marker image which will make life easier in the next lecture. Download the image at the link in Github Repo over here:
